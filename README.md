# line-follower-robot
A line follower robot is a device that can detect and follow a line drawn on the floor. The line can be visible, like a black line on a white surface, or invisible, like a magnetic field

I bought all the electronic parts necessary to build a line-follower robot:

-> 1 transparent chassis of plastic<br>
-> 4 motors<br>
-> 4 wheels<br>
-> L298N motor driver board<br>
-> ARDUINO UNO<br>
-> 5 TCRT5000 infrared sensors<br>
-> 5 LEDs<br>
-> 5 resistors <br>
-> 2 battery boxes<br>
-> 3 batteries<br>
-> 1 USB cable for Arduino<br>
-> Cables, screws and bolts<br>
