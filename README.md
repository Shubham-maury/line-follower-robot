# line-follower-robot
A line follower robot is a device that can detect and follow a line drawn on the floor. The line can be visible, like a black line on a white surface, or invisible, like a magnetic field

I bought all the electronic parts necessary to build a line-follower robot:

-> 1 transparent chassis of plastic
-> 4 motors
-> 4 wheels
-> L298N motor driver board
-> ARDUINO UNO
-> 5 TCRT5000 infrared sensors
-> 5 LEDs
-> 5 resistors 
-> 2 battery boxes
-> 3 batteries
-> 1 USB cable for Arduino
-> Cables, screws and bolts
